UE4SDLController
================

https://github.com/ScatteredRay/UE4SDLController/

Plugin for UE4 taking advantage of the SDL Game Controller api in order to get broader gamepad support on Windows.

Currentlly only tested on Windows with the PS4 controller, In theory with minor modifications it should support a large set of "Xbox 360" compatable gamepads on much more platforms, but at least libs will have to be updated for other platforms.

Installation
------------

Clone UE4SDLController into SDLController under your projects plugin directory.
Regenerate UE4 projects and compile.
